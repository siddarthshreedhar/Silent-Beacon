# Silent-Beacon
A real‑time, lip‑reading distress‑signal detector built with TensorFlow and OpenCV. “Silent Beacon” monitors a live camera feed, transcribes silent speech via a 3D‑CNN + BiLSTM model with CTC decoding, detects predefined distress keywords, and instantly raises an alert—complete with logs, snapshot GIFs, and configurable notification hooks.
